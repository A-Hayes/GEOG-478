WebGIS

Course Description: Investigation of web-based geographic information systems; introduction to server-oriented architectures for web-based applications and services; development of web applications; management of web servers, web services and databases. 

Notes: Aside from instruction in HTML/CSS and Javascript, attention was paid towards structure, visual design, and embedding of ArcGIS Online maps and data. This compounded on the design work I did on the portal I helped design during my internship, but with less restrictions on display and medium. 

Run Info: All .html and .json files may be edited with text editor of choice (written in Notepad++) and viewed running with any browser supporting HTML5/CSS/Javascript.

Usage Note: This repo is for display/reference purposes only. Do not use for your own coursework, cheating/plagirism will not be tolerated. If you are an instructor for this course and want to request that I take this repo down, please open a new Issue indicating such and I will comply promptly.
